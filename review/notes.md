## Quick observations while reading
- Don't pretend you did any original work if you just reviewed the examples from the paper.
- Proofread more thoroughly!
- If you say "papers such as" don't cite them with braced author/year.
- Don't know if reciting the original sources makes sense...
- Why use R_i if there is already P_i?
- You don't minimize formulas but functions.
- Figure 2 is never referenced/explained.
- In figure 2 the red line (cost P2) should start at zero and end at one imho. The cost is INCREASING linearly with the share of agents taking the path and not DECREASING. This does not affect the shape of the total cost though.
