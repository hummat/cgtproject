The paper \textit{Reducing Congestion Through Information Design} which is reviewed in the report \textit{Deception For The Greater Good: Minimizing Traffic Congestion With
Information Design} we are going to evaluate in this article, deals with the problem of suboptimal decisions of Bayesian agents in the context of games with uncertain congestions when given complete information of the system. The reviewing group developed and used simulation software to replicate the results seen in the aforementioned paper.
