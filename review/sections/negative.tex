\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{Language:} The linguistic usage is in large parts perfectly adequate but there are several avoidable idiomatic and grammatical mistakes throughout the report which complicate understanding.
 \item \textbf{Notation:} The notation used in the equations is in parts overloaded, when variables are reassigned to have new meanings and in parts redundant, when the same concept is assigned to several variables. This impedes comprehension significantly. Each abstraction should be explained explicitly instead of imposing on the reader to deduce it.
 \item \textbf{Structure and Content:} The structure of the report is not very clear. Though there is an outline of what to expect in the introduction, the sections typically found in papers (\textit{Introduction, Methods, Results/Discussion, Conclusion}) are only partially present and content expected in one section is found in another or is scattered over several sections.
