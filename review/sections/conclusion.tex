\todo{Evaluate whether the conclusion is sufficient} \textcolor{green}{\Large\checkmark}\\
An actual conclusion is entirely missing. The report is not summarized at all but there is an outlook paragraph as part of the discussion. The discussion on the other hand is missing any reference to, and explanation of, the obtained results. While the naming of the concluding section has neither to be \textit{Discussion} nor \textit{Conclusion}--though this definitely is a fairly standardized naming convention--the content of those sections has to appear somewhere in the work.
