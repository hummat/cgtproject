\todo{Evaluate whether the methods are clearly explained (can the results be reproduced?)} \textcolor{green}{\Large\checkmark}\\
The methods used in the report can be divided into two parts. Those already found in the original work are predominantly well explained, but notational inconsistencies complicate comprehension (see subsection \ref{sub:style} for an elaboration of this issue).

New aspects, like the problem formulation for finding the optimal agent-to-path mapping, also suffer from notation noise, but are otherwise well presented. The so called \textit{Simulator}, arguably the most original part of the whole work, is unfortunately only treated superficially without going into the implementational details. In particular it is not entirely clear, how and if it was used for the previously presented results.
