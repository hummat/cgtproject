As we deal with three different texts throughout this evaluation it might help to assign to each of them a unique name. Therefore, if we speak of the  \textit{paper} we mean the original work by Das et al (2017) titled \textit{Reducing Congestion Through Information Desig}. The \textit{report} denotes the review on the aforementioned paper titled \textit{Deception For The Greater Good: Minimizing Traffic Congestion With Information Design} written by Ka\"{i}s Albichari, Raymond Lochner, Rodrigue Van Brande and Tanguy d'Hose. Lastly we will say the \textit{article} when speaking about the evaluation you are reading right now.

The article is organized into two parts. In this one, apart from clarifying notation, we will evaluate the different sections of the report on the basis of the questions from the specification found online and the mail the report was attached to. The second part will provide overall general positive and negative remarks as well as questions on the content of the report.
