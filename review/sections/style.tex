The overall style of the article is somewhat of a mixed bag. While the formulas and the text are nicely typeset, using subsections and paragraphs to increase readability, there are a lot of idiomatic and expressive flaws and spelling mistakes. The citation style is very unusual and inconsistent. Many variable names are reassigned to new purposes multiple times (e.g. $P_i$ being first a path name, then the argument to the cost function $c(\cdot)$--previously taking the share of agents $x$ on a path also called $s_i$ later while $s$ is additionally a node in the directed graph--and then it becomes the path cost function itself) making it hard to follow the mathematical reasoning. The figures are informative and clear though the labeling of figure 2 is too small.
