\todo{Evaluate whether the introduction explains clearly the content of the paper}\\
The abstract should be more elaborated in terms of what the paper is about. An interested reader might now have a vague idea of the topics that are about to be discussed.  We don't immediately see why selfishness of agents in a traffic system is a motivation for the study.

The introduction provides a clear overview of topics that will be discussed but contains spelling mistakes. Since this is your first impression to the reader, we highly recommend to review the phrasing. Subsequently, the second paragraph states that it is a 'very active topic' but the references that back up this claim come from the same author and date from 2005. It would be good to highlight a more recent paper or remove the 'active topic' claim.
