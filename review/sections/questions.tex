\todo{Name at least 3 clear and relevant questions on the content or the methods used which can be asked (next to other questions)} \textcolor{green}{\Large\checkmark}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{Simulator:} How exactly does the simulator work? How was it implemented and what are its capabilities and shortcomings?
 \item \textbf{Discussion:} What can be learned from the obtained results? Are they useful and for what? How do they compare to those from the original work?
 \item \textbf{Hindsight:} Looking back, what would you have done differently with the knowledge gained and where there any difficulties that arose during development? Did you find any contradictions or ambiguities in the papers or was everything clearly laid out? 
\end{enumerate}
