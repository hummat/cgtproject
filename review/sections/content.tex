\todo{Evaluate whether you believe things are missing in the discussion} \textcolor{green}{\Large\checkmark ?}\\
As already mentioned in subsection \ref{sub:conclusion}, the obtained results are not thoroughly discussed. Here and there, scattered throughout what seems to be the result section(s), explanatory sentences are to be found. There is however no clear and final overview of the obtained results, explaining their meaning and comparing them to those published in the original work.
