# Computational Game Theory Project

Code and report for the final project of the Computational Game Theory course at Vrije Universitetit Brussel (VUB) WS2017.

## Paper: Accelerating multi-agent reinforcement learning with dynamic co-learning 

## Directories
Explanation of the proposed directory structure. Feel free to change anything you don't like.
